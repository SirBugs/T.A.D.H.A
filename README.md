I was Getting The App Request For Cracking ..
Suddenly I FoundOut That The Data That's Being Sent Is Hashed ..
Then I Got The Replces For : 
-/|\:;()[]{}<>!#$%^&*=+_.@
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789

A = 44
B = 47
C = 46
D = 41
E = 40
F = 43
J = 42
H = 4d
I = 4c
J = 4f
K = 4e
L = 49
M = 48
N = 4b
O = 4a
P = 55
Q = 54
R = 57
S = 56
T = 51
U = 50
V = 53
W = 52
X = 5d
Y = 5c
Z = 5f
a = 64
b = 67
c = 66
d = 61
e = 60
f = 63

{ = 7e
} = 78
< = 39
> = 3b
! = 24
# = 26
$ = 21
% = 20
^ = 5b
& = 23
* = 2f
= = 38
+ = 2e
_ = 5a
. = 2b
@ = 45

And I Made A Python Script For Encrypting / Decrypting.
For Using Encrypting use [ def ENCRYPT() ]
For Using Decrypting use [ def DECRYPT() 

Have Fun!!
